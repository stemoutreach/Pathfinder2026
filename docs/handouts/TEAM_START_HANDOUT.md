# Pathfinder2026 Team Start Handout

Use this handout to get your team to the Pathfinder2026 GitHub repo and through the first phase: Assemble.

## Team Roles

For a 3-person team:

| Person | First job |
|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Set up the Pi 500 control hub |
| 2 | Start assembling the robot |
| 3 | Track the checklist, record the robot IP, and read the Course Challenge |

Person 3 should write down:

- The robot IP
- Battery check result
- Motor and servo check result
- First issue the team needs help with
- One simple Course Challenge strategy

If the team gets stuck, Person 3 should compare notes with another team before asking a facilitator, unless the issue involves wiring, batteries, heat, smoke, broken parts, or `sudo` commands.

## Open The GitHub Repo

On the Pi 500, open a browser and go to:

```text
https://github.com/stemoutreach/Pathfinder2026
```

Or scan:

## Pi 500 Track

Goal: get the Pi 500 ready as the team's coding and control hub.

1. Connect monitor, mouse, and power.
2. Boot the Pi 500.
3. Connect to workshop WiFi.
4. Open a terminal with `Ctrl+Alt+T`.
5. Confirm internet:
   ```bash
   ping -c 3 google.com
   ```
6. Open the Pathfinder2026 GitHub repo in the browser.
7. Verify VS Code and the required extensions:
   - Python
   - Remote - SSH

## robot Assembly Track

Goal: build a robot that is safe to power and test.

1. Unpack robot parts.
2. Assemble the chassis.
3. Install mecanum wheels.
4. Attach arm and gripper.
5. Mount camera and sonar.
6. Install charged batteries.
7. Check that cables cannot touch wheels or arm joints.

## Meet Back Together

When the Pi 500 is ready and the robot is assembled:

1. Find the robot IP using the robot Pi/WiFi guide.
2. Open the robot Pi/WiFi guide:
   ```text
   docs/setup/ROBOT_PI_WIFI_SETUP.md
   ```
3. Open the connect/test guide:
   ```text
   docs/setup/CONNECT_AND_TEST.md
   ```
4. Connect from the Pi 500 to the robot:
   ```bash
   ssh robot@<ROBOT_IP>
   ```
5. Run battery, camera, arm, and drive checks.

Use only the robot IP for SSH, VS Code Remote SSH, and web controls.
