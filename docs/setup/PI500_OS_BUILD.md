# Pi 500 OS Build

**Purpose:** Create the SD card image for the Raspberry Pi 500 (team control hub)

**Platform:** Raspberry Pi 500
**OS:** Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit), Debian 13 (Trixie)
**Image type:** Desktop
**Raspberry Pi Imager:** 2.0.0
**Current Pi OS Released:** 2026-06-18
**Kernel version:** 6.18
**Last tested:** 2026-06-18
**Time:** ~20 minutes

> **OS Note:** Use the Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit release dated **2026-06-18**. Raspberry Pi lists this image as Debian 13 (Trixie) with kernel 6.18. This guide was last tested on **2026-06-18**.

The Pi 500 is your **command center** — you'll use it to write code, SSH into the robot, monitor camera feeds, and run all workshop scripts. The robot runs headless; you control everything from here.

## Materials Needed

- Team kit BOM: [BOM_TEAM_KIT.md](BOM_TEAM_KIT.md)
- Raspberry Pi 500 kit (keyboard computer)
- microSD card (32GB+ recommended)
- USB mouse
- Portable monitor + Micro HDMI to HDMI adapter
- Power supply (USB-C, included with Pi 500 kit)
- Another computer with internet (for imaging the SD card)

## Step 1: Download Raspberry Pi OS

1. Download [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) on your computer
2. Insert microSD card into your computer
3. Open Raspberry Pi Imager
4. Choose OS: **Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** — Desktop version, released 2026-06-18
5. Choose Storage: Select your microSD card
6. Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) for advanced settings:
   - Set device name / hostname: `pihub`
   - Enable SSH (password authentication)
   - Set username: `pi500`
   - Set password: (your choice, document it!)
   - Configure WiFi: Enter your workshop network SSID and password
   - Set locale: Your timezone
7. Click **Write** and wait for completion

Use `pihub` and `pi500` consistently for the Pi 500. The robot uses the `robot` account separately.

## Step 2: First Boot

1. Insert SD card into Pi 500
2. Connect monitor via Micro HDMI adapter
3. Connect USB mouse
4. Plug in power — Pi 500 will boot to desktop

## Step 3: Verify Setup

Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and verify:

```bash
# Check WiFi
ping -c 3 google.com
# Should succeed

# Check Python
python3 --version
# Should show Python 3.13.x

# Check SSH is running
sudo systemctl status ssh
# Should show: active (running)
```

## Step 4: Install Local Workshop Docs

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Optional: if you want a local copy of the workshop docs, install git
sudo apt install -y git

# Optional: clone the workshop repository for local docs, checklists, and examples
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/stemoutreach/Pathfinder2026.git
cd Pathfinder2026
```

Optional: if you want to read docs without switching back to GitHub, keep a local clone on the Pi 500. Robot code still runs on the robot through VS Code Remote SSH.

Optional: if you want to run separate Pi 500-side camera or AprilTag experiments, install OpenCV, AprilTag, and NumPy on the Pi 500. Otherwise, leave those packages on the robot.

## Step 5: Confirm Network Connection

```bash
hostname -I
# Example: 10.10.10.141
```

This confirms the Pi 500 is on the network. Do not use this IP for robot connections.

For the event, the important address is the robot IP confirmed during robot setup. Use that robot IP with SSH, VS Code Remote SSH, and the web control page.

## Step 6: Install Visual Studio Code

Use the terminal install for the event build. It is repeatable and easy to verify:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y code
```

If that command cannot find `code`, use **Raspberry Pi menu -> Preferences -> Recommended Software**, check **Visual Studio Code**, then click **Apply**.

## Step 7: Install VS Code Extensions

Install the VS Code extensions needed later during the event. Teams will connect the Pi 500 to the robot in [CONNECT_AND_TEST.md](CONNECT_AND_TEST.md).

**Install required Pi 500 VS Code extensions:**

```bash
code --install-extension ms-python.python
code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh
```

Or install them through the VS Code interface:

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open Extensions
3. Search for and install:
   - **Python** (Microsoft)
   - **Remote - SSH** (Microsoft)

## What's on the Pi 500

After setup, your Pi 500 has:

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Raspberry Pi OS Desktop | Debian 13 Trixie, 64-bit desktop environment |
| Python 3 | Basic scripting and tools |
| SSH client | Connect to robot remotely |
| Visual Studio Code + Remote SSH | Write and run robot code directly on the robot |
| Pathfinder2026 repo | Local copy of workshop docs, checklists, and examples |
| Terminal | Command line for SSH, git, python |

## What's NOT on the Pi 500

- No motor/servo drivers (those are on the robot)
- No hardware SDK (robot only)
- No camera access to robot camera (use SSH + web interface)
- No OpenCV, AprilTag, or NumPy required unless doing optional Pi 500-side vision testing

The Pi 500 is the **brain**. The robot is the **body**. They talk over WiFi.

## Pre-Built Option

For workshops, the facilitator can pre-image all SD cards to save time:

1. Build one Pi 500 image following steps above
2. Use Raspberry Pi Imager to clone the SD card
3. Update each clone's device label if needed
4. Pre-connect to workshop WiFi

This skips 15-20 minutes of setup per team.
